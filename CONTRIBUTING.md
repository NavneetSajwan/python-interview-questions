## Guidelines

To ensure smooth collaboration and maintain consistency within the Python Interview Questions project, please follow these guidelines:

- **Be respectful**: Treat others with respect and kindness. Be open to constructive feedback and discussion.

- **Provide clear and detailed questions**: When adding new interview questions, make sure they are clear, concise, and provide enough context. Include possible answers or explanations if applicable.

- **Organize questions**: Ensure that questions are placed in relevant sections based on their topic or difficulty level.

- **Format code properly**: If your contribution includes code examples, follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code formatting to maintain consistency.

- **Test your changes**: Before submitting a pull request, make sure your changes work as intended. Test the questions and code examples to ensure they run correctly.

- **Check for duplicates**: Verify that the questions you're adding don't already exist in the collection. Duplicate questions can be confusing and clutter the repository.

- **Keep pull requests focused**: Submit separate pull requests for each distinct change or addition. This makes it easier for maintainers to review and merge your contributions.
