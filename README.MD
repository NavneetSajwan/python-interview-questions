# Python Interview Questions

This repository contains an IPython Notebook with a collection of Python interview questions. These questions can be used to prepare for Python programming interviews or to enhance your understanding of Python concepts.

## Notebook Contents

The IPython Notebook (`interview_questions.ipynb`) contains the following sections:

1. Introduction: A brief overview of the interview questions and their purpose.
2. Python Basics: Questions covering fundamental Python concepts such as data types, control flow, and functions.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Questions related to object-oriented programming principles in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
4. Data Structures: Questions focusing on common data structures in Python, such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
5. Algorithms: Questions exploring algorithms and problem-solving techniques, such as recursion, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
6. Libraries and Modules: Questions related to popular Python libraries and modules, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
7. Advanced Topics: Additional questions covering advanced Python topics, including generators, decorators, context managers, and concurrency.
