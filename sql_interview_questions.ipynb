    "### The order of operation of SQL clauses is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: The `FROM` clause specifies the table or tables from which data will be queried. This is the first clause in the order of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE**: The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the rows that meet a specified condition. It operates on the rows selected in the `FROM` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY**: The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the selected rows into sets based on the values of one or more columns. It is often used in combination with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING**: The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the grouped rows after the `GROUP BY` clause has been applied. It operates on the grouped results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT**: The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns to be included in the result set. It comes after the `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY**: The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It is typically the last clause in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are used for pagination. They limit the number of rows returned and specify the starting point of the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and the order may vary slightly depending on the specific query and its requirements."
