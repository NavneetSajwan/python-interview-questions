    "AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (extract, transform, load) service by Amazon Web Services. It automates data preparation tasks, offers a visual or code-based job authoring interface, leverages Apache Spark for transformations, and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services. It's a serverless solution, simplifying ETL workflows and enabling users to focus on data analysis rather than managing infrastructure."
